# Newbie Navigate

This is a basic website that tries to create a central website where incoming freshmen students can find clubs and peer mentors to help them get accustomed to college life.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for our project was how we remembered our freshmen year. We recalled that during our freshman year the hardest part about the on-boarding process was finding a new community after graduating high school. So our idea was a general hub area for freshman engineering students at UTD.
## What it does
Our website has 5 buttons one has a list of the most popular clubs on campus. Another has a form that you can fill out to add your club to be approved or add an event to be dynamically added to our calendar tab. And our last tab is peer mentoring which introduces the incoming students to the many resources on campus.
## How we built it
We used html, JavaScript, and CSS mostly, but for the form and calendar I used googles calendar API along with google app script to transfer imputed data into a google sheet and then from there it is added to the calendar.
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a lot of challenges as it is all of our first times at a hackathon as well as having little to no experience in html and CSS. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The accomplishment I was most proud of was being able to take the data from the form in html and using google app script to transfer the values into a google sheet and then run another script to transfer the data from the sheet into a calendar that updates live. 
## What we learned
As a individuals I believe we all learned what a hackathon is and the format, but most importantly we learned the basics of html and front-end development. As a group we learned what our many strengths and weaknesses were so that next time we can work on things that we are individually better at. 
## What's next for Newbie Navigator
On a more scalable level Newbie Navigator would have a lot more data to work with and have active participation in adding events and pushing advertisements of clubs online. Although our website is a very rough right now with enough time to clean everything up it could be a real resource that incoming freshmen could use to get more involved on campus.
